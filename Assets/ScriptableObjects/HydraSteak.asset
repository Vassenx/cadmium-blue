  qualityString:
  - Whew, that was quite the battle, but no problem - the steak is still raw. You
    could serve it rare if you want to.
  - AHH!! CURSES!!! My cake :''(( Why am I always called to slaughter when I'm baking??
  - Errr, this steak is a little stringy... It'll have to do, I guess. Hopefully
    desert makes up for it!
  - Mmm, the perfect sear :) Back just in time! Dinner tonight is looking good.
