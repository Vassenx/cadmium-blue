  - ' AHHHH!! The eggs are burnt to a crisp!! :''( Hopefully you can save your dinner
    date with the other dishes...'
  - Whew! Back in no time at all. The eggs are still raw! Plenty of time to finish
    cooking :)
  - Oh no... That summoner kept you just a little too long :( These eggs are edible,
    but pretty dry...
  - That was a close one! But the eggs are perfectly cooked. Some deviled eggs for
    your favorite devil tonight :)
