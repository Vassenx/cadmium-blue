  - Ah, look at the time! There was no need to rush at all. Time for some light reading
    while the cake finishes baking?
  - Well that was quite the skirmish! Hopefully no more calls tonight. This cake
    is perfect - light and fluffy :)
  - Ack! Always getting summoned at the wrong time! This is definitely overcooked...
    Ah, well...
  - AHH!! CURSES!!! My cake :''(( Why am I always called to slaughter when I'm baking??
